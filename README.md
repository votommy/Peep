# Peep
Peep allows users to browse, create, and promote events while at the same time making it a functional site for social interaction. We believe that great stories and memories are made through communal and societal interaction.
Bringing ideas to life is our purpose as a company. We help you coordinate and create these ideas and turn them into events and opportunities to connect and spend time with friends and family. We aim to connect people and places.

## About the program:
This project is a sample website written in pure HTML with no help from template frameworks such as Bootstrap.
